# Zork Game - Java Swing Learning Project

## Description

Zork Game is a simple 2D game developed in Java Swing with the aim of learning and practicing Swing, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Inheritance, and Interfaces. This project was created as part of a class and was developed in just 3 weeks.

The game was inspired by classic text adventure games like the legendary "Zork." Although it's a simplified version, it provides an opportunity for Java beginners to learn and apply important programming concepts.
